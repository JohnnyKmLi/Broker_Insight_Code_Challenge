# Broker_Insight_Code_Challenge
This project was developed using a local server XAMPP.

# Installing Xampp local server
1. Navigate to https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html.
2. Install the latest window version.
3. Execute the installer and keep a record of details and where you have installed to.

# Starting Xampp
1. Navigate to the Xampp directory which you should have a note of (default: C:\xampp).
2. Execute `xampp-control.exe`.
3. When window starts up you should see a list of modules Apache, MySQL, FileZilla, etc (we will only be using Apache and MySQL).
4. Click the start actions for the module "Apache" and "MySQL".
5. Use a browser on your computer (I'm using google chrome).
6. In the browser type the url `http://localhost/phpmyadmin` (this will take you the phpmyadmin application on the xampp server, this will hangle the database).
7. Import the customer and policy database that can be found this repo. If this does not work copy the sql script found in the repo and fire the sql script, this should create the tables and data for the database.
